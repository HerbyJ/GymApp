# GymApp
The purpose of this app was to help me keep track of progress for each workout at the gym.
There are a lot of equipment with the same functionality, so I added a picture capability to help determine which machine is which.
For example, there are several row machines at the gym. Each one has a different feel, so 100lbs on one machine may be easier/harder
than on another machine. 

This app will help resolve any confusion about stats on each machine. Now I can look at a picture and see what
machine I was on.

This app was built in Android Studio.
This was an easy app to build. The hardest part was the picture functionality. After API 18, the rules for taking pictures and storing
them has changed, and Android's documentation on it isn't clear about the new procedure.
